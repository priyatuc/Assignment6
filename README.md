# Project Overview

This repository contains my submission for a two-part assignment focused on algorithm analysis and fundamental data structure implementations.

The project is divided into:
    Part I – Implementation and Analysis of Selection Algorithms
    Part II – Elementary Data Structures: Implementation and Discussion

Each part includes Python implementations along with performance and complexity analysis.

## Part I – : Implementation and Analysis of Selection Algorithms

  This section includes implementations of:
  
   - Deterministic Selection Algorithm (Median-of-Medians)
   - Randomized Selection Algorithm (QuickSelect)

  **Included files**
  
        Deterministic_Algorithm.py 
        Randomized_Algorithm.py
        Comparision_Deterministic_Randomized.py
        
  **Report**
  
          Part I  Implementation & Analysis of Selection Algorithms.pdf contains the following reports:
            Implementation for both algorithms
            Performance Analysis 
            Empirical Performance Analysis (runtime experiments)
            Space Complexity Discussion

**How to Run the Code:**

  Prerequisites
    Python 3.8 or above
    Visual Studio Code or any Python IDE

 Copy and paste the code from the respective .py files into your IDE, save them, and run them to observe the results.
   

## Part II –  Elementary Data Structures: Implementation and Discussion

  This section includes custom implementations of:
    Arrays
    Matrices
    Linked Lists
    Queues
    Stacks

  Included in Part II
    Python implementations for each data structure
    Performance Analysis (operations such as insert, delete, access, search, etc.)
    Real-World Use Cases and Discussion of implementation relevance

**How to Run the Code**
Prerequisites
  Python 3.8 or above

No external libraries are required unless otherwise noted (e.g., time module for experimentation)
