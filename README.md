**Project Overview**

This repository contains my submission for a two-part assignment focused on algorithm analysis and fundamental data structure implementations.

The project is divided into:

Part I – Implementation and Analysis of Selection Algorithms

Part II – Elementary Data Structures: Implementation and Discussion

Each part includes Python implementations along with performance and complexity analysis.

Part I – Selection Algorithms

This section includes implementations of:

Deterministic Selection Algorithm (Median-of-Medians)

Randomized Selection Algorithm (QuickSelect)

Included in Part I

Python code for both algorithms

Time Complexity Analysis

Empirical Performance Analysis (runtime experiments)

Space Complexity Discussion

Part II – Elementary Data Structures

This section includes custom implementations of:

Arrays

Matrices

Linked Lists

Queues

Stacks

Included in Part II

Python implementations for each data structure

Performance Analysis (operations such as insert, delete, access, search, etc.)

Real-World Use Cases and Discussion of implementation relevance

How to Run the Code
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or above

No external libraries are required unless otherwise noted (e.g., time module for experimentation)
